## Functionality

### Object segmentation

Detect distinct objects in a 3D scene and cut them out of the environment.

### Texture segmentation

The main goal of this package is to enable a texture based segmentation of meshes. Especially focussing on the materials of the object. This can be done 

### Mesh refinement

using the texture of a mesh to cut the faces of a mesh to refine the segmentation

### semantic uv unwrapping

unwrapping a mesh based on its semantic meaning to improve same material grouping and minimize distortion.
